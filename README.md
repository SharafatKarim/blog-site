Contents of my [blog site](https://sharafat.pages.dev/). Feel free to contribute!

There's an another feeling whenever you do something for the first time, right? And this is the first post of this website so it's quite important for me 😅.
Let's get started!

## Previous page?
So what about my previous webpage (that was an static HTML page). And of course there was some CSS. It's still alive, I think 😅. Try the following link,
- [Legacy one](https://sharafatkarim.github.io/legacy-site/)

## How?
If you want to know how I build this site, then my answer is,
- HUGO
- Love It (Hugo theme)

### Guide
I've written a lot about them in another post. You may also get almost all of the important links there. Here's the link,
- [Love It Hugo](https://sharafatkarim.github.io/love-it-hugo/)

### Copyright
Those two are well documented and you can easily use them without actually learning HTML and CSS. And of course if you want to reuse my configurations and posts, feel free to do so. Fork [my repository](https://github.com/SharafatKarim/SharafatKarim.github.io). If you also copy my articles, I'll really appreciate it if you at least become my friend 😅.

## Where?
So where can I host them and price? Well, I use GitHub to host for free and I don't have the money to buy a domain name. So yeah! You can host for free or maybe....... 😅

## Tutorial?
Just read those documentations 🧐, and if you still has issues feel free to text me. Maybe I'll create a tutorial, who knows? 😅
