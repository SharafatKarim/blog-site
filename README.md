# blog-site
Contents of my [blog site](https://sharafat.pages.dev/). Feel free to contribute!

## Address?
Entering shrafatkarim.github.io will redirect you to [sharafat.pages.dev](https://sharafat.pages.dev/)

### Why redirection?
I moved my webpage there (cloudflare page) cause I may use some sensitive information in the config file of the website. But you can still read or contribute to my webpage. If you want to create a website like that one, I've a free template available for you!


## Previous page?
So what about my previous webpage (that was an static HTML page). And of course there was some CSS. It's still alive, I think 😅. Try the following link,
- [Legacy one](https://sharafatkarim.github.io/legacy-site/)

## How?
If you want to know how I build this site, then my answer is,
- HUGO
- _Love It (Hugo theme)_ (currently I'm using [FeelIt](https://feelit.khusika.dev/))

### Guide
I've written a lot about them in another post. You may also get almost all of the important links there. Here's the link,
- [Love It Hugo](https://sharafat.pages.dev/love-it-hugo/)

### Copyright
Those two are well documented and you can easily use them without actually learning HTML and CSS. And of course if you want to reuse my configurations and posts, feel free to do so. I'll share a hugo template soon(hope). If you also copy my articles, I'll really appreciate it if you at least become my friend 😅.

## Where?
So where can I host them and price? Well, I _used GitHub to host for free_ (currently cloudflare pages) and I don't have the money to buy a domain name. So yeah! You can host for free or maybe....... 😅

## Tutorial?
Just read those documentations 🧐, and if you still has issues feel free to text me. Maybe I'll create a tutorial, who knows? 😅
