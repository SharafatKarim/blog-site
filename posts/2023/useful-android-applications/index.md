Yet an another list of useful Applications that you
can try in Android. FOSS (Free and Open Source) is always prioritized over proprietary. Feel free to help me to enrich this list!  

{{< admonition note "Note" true >}}
This list's formatting is "Applications name" and "short description".
Play store or f-droid links are not provided by default and so I'll recommend you to use a search engine.
****Common applications which are almost known by everyone is omitted for simplicity.***

This list is nowhere near complete mostly collected by me and my friends. If you need more detailed and vast list, try the following link:
