Some of the useful desktop browser extensions for daily driving. Some of the extensions are only available for ***Firefox*** or Firefox based browsers. Please keep it in mind.

{{< admonition note "BTW," >}}
This is a simple personal collection. There might be more better extensions that I may not know. I'll appreciate it if you share your experience with us.
{{< /admonition >}}

# Most useful ones
These may help you every single day!

##  BitWarden

A free and open source password manager. Used to store all of your passwords and notes. Well, it also have features that can be extended with premium membership, but free plan is good enough for personal daily driving cases.

## Dark Reader

Isn't it sometimes hard to read sites with 'white' background? Especially in nighttime? For example, you can switch current site to light theme! This extension can help you in this case. BTW, it's free and open source.

- [Website](https://darkreader.org/)
- [Firefox store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/)

## Firefox Multi-Account Containers

The Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives ‚Äì no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a quick video showing you how it works.

- [Firefox store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)

## Firefox Relay

It'll help you to protect your email. It lets you generate unique, random aliases you can use to sign up for accounts, apps, or newsletters, and forwards messages to your real address. If you find that an account is sending unwanted email or spam, you can block the alias and it will stop sending email to your inbox. Once you no longer want an account, you can delete the alias.

- [Firefox store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/)

# Also,
check some of those. Maybe you will find something unexpected, üéÉ who knows ÿü

## TinEye Reverse Image Search
TinEye uses image identification technology, not keywords: when you upload an image to TinEye, TinEye creates a unique and compact digital signature or 'fingerprint' for it, then compares this fingerprint to every other image in the TinEye index to find matches. TinEye does not typically find similar images; it finds exact matches including those that have been cropped, edited or resized.
