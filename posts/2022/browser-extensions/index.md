Some of the useful desktop browser extentions for daily driving. Some of the extensions are only available for ***Firefox*** or Firefox based browsers. Please keep it in mind.

{{< admonition note "BTW," >}}
This is a simple personal collection. There might be more better extensions that I may not know. I'll appreciate it if you share your experience with us.
{{< /admonition >}}

# Most useful ones
These may help you every single day!

##  Bitwarden

A free and open source password manager. Used to store all of your passwords and notes. Well, it also have features that can be extended with premium membership, but free plan is good enough for personal daily driving cases.

## Dark Reader

## Firefox Multi-Account Containers

## Firefox Relay

It'll help you to protect your email. It lets you generate unique, random aliases you can use to sign up for accounts, apps, or newsletters, and forwards messages to your real address. If you find that an account is sending unwanted email or spam, you can block the alias and it will stop sending email to your inbox. Once you no longer want an account, you can delete the alias.
