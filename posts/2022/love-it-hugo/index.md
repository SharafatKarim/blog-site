Umm, Love It, and hugo? What's going on?

> Hugo
>> A static site genarator

> Love It
>> Yet an another hugo theme

## What's big deal?

This article is mainly about `Love IT` theme's specialities but maybe you can go ahead to it's [repo](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) and learn for your own. So I'll be focusing on it's shortcodes which is an important element in hugo!

If you don't know about shortcodes then here's an example,
Writing,

```markdown
{{</* youtube ULDrp20nwfE  */>}}
```

will output,

{{< youtube ULDrp20nwfE  >}}

So, long story short, if you want to learn more about shortcodes check [Links and references](#links-and-references)

### Some useful shortcodes
What I like most is admonition! Also there are quite a few but I like it more than others. Here's some sample:

{{< admonition >}}
A **note** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition abstract >}}
An **abstract** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition info >}}
A **info** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip >}}
A **tip** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition success >}}
A **success** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition question >}}
A **question** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition warning >}}
A **warning** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition failure >}}
A **failure** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition danger >}}
A **danger** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition bug >}}
A **bug** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition example >}}
An **example** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition quote >}}
A **quote** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

### Admonition, it is!
So how do we actually use it? üßê

Here's an input,
```markdown
{{</* admonition type=tip title="This is a tip" open=false */>}}
A **tip** banner
{{</* /admonition */>}}
Or
{{</* admonition tip "This is a tip" false */>}}
A **tip** banner
{{</* /admonition */>}}
```
And the output:
{{< admonition tip "This is a tip" false >}}
A **tip** banner
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition quote "Fun Fact" false >}}
You know what? Above admonition part is directly copy pasted from Extended shortcodes part of Love It's documentation üòÖ
{{< /admonition >}}

## FAQ

Do I need to learn html, css or anything else for generating static sites?
- Short answer, no. Long answer, maybe duckduckgo and Google can help you find it. üéØ

Is it free?
- Well, if you host on GitHub and don't need any domain just like me, then yeah! It's free.

Got any more question?
- Feel free to text me ‚ú®

## Extra

Let me share a trick! In this website, you'll see headings starting with a vertical line or `#`, You can basically right click on them and copy a link which will work as a hyperlink to that specific Heading!
