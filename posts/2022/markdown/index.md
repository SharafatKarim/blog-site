This article shows some useful and daily-driver type syntax, that I may use daily. First, right after heading, one example , followed by it's syntax. I won't explain though üòÖ.

{{< admonition >}}
  To learn in detail and easily, you may use following references,

  - [LoveIt theme documentation](https://hugoloveit.com/basic-markdown-syntax/)
  - [GRAV documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/content/markdown)

  and of course, there is GitHub wiki. I don't think I need to mention this. üòÖ

(Above code) +/- doesn't matter here!

## Task List
``` markdown

```
- [ ] this task is incomplete
- [x] this task is completed

``` markdown
`code can be in any language` along with text
```
`code can be in any language` along with text

## Indented Code
Indented= putting *some lines* before **a line**, used in *programming*, right? Here we've to use at least 4 space üßê, though I don't know the reason üòÑ.
``` markdown
    <pre>
      Yo! This is a test to write
      forward slash = /
      backward slash = \
    </pre>
```

      forward slash = /
      backward slash = \
    </pre>

## Block Fenced Code
``` markdown
    ``` cpp
    #include <iostream>
    int main ()
    {
        std::cout << "Hello world! \nHow cool is that?";
        return 0;
    }
    ```
```
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
int main ()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world! \nHow cool is that?";
    return 0;
}
```

**Fun Fact ‚õ±Ô∏è**

I used `cpp` after first ``` to enable syntax highlighting for c++. Same can be used for javascript (js), markdown (md) or any other languages.

## Table

``` markdown
|Left align|Center align|Right align|
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
|Fist column, First row|Second column, First row|Third column, First row|
|First column, Second row|Second column, Second row|Third column, Second row|
|First column, Third row|Second column, Third row|Third column, Third row|
```
|Left align|Center align|Right align|
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
|Fist column, First row|Second column, First row|Third column, First row|
|First column, Second row|Second column, Second row|Third column, Second row|
|First column, Third row|Second column, Third row|Third column, Third row|

{{< admonition >}}
Table without alignment (without using `:`, just `---`) will center align the first row. Second onwards will be using left align!
