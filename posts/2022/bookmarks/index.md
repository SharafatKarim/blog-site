{{< admonition quote "And, another thing" >}}
*If you can't forget the name of a website then that site doesn't deserve to be your bookmark* 

And with that quote of mine I avoided social sites and other sites that you can't forget easily! For example, Facebook. Now my question is why can't we forget it? Let us know in the comment.
